# InsightsLM: The Open Source NotebookLM Alternative


> What if the power of a tool like NotebookLM wasn't locked away in a closed system? What if you could build a private, self-hosted alternative that can be customized for your business needs, all without writing a single line of code?

That's exactly what we've done with **InsightsLM**. This project is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to NotebookLM. It's designed to be a powerful AI research tool that grounds its responses exclusively in the sources you provide, making it a reliable window into your company's knowledge base.


## About The Project

NotebookLM is one of the most powerful AI research tools available today. However, its closed-source nature limits its potential for customization and private hosting. InsightsLM was created to bridge this gap.

This isn't just a basic prototype. It's a robust application with some killer features, developed using a "vibe-coding" approach with Loveable for the Javascript frontend and a powerful backend combination of Supabase and N8N.

We are open-sourcing InsightsLM so you can install it, customize it, improve it, and even commercialize it. The ability to deploy AI agents grounded in a company's specific knowledge (a concept known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG) represents one of the biggest commercial opportunities for generative AI today.
